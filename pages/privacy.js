                We believe that your data is your business. When use certish to
                sign or verify data, the contents of that data never leave your
                browser.

                When you sign data with certish, this is what happens:
            </WideParagraph>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If you&apos;re signed in and have an associated private key,
                    we&apos;ll securely send your private key to your browser,
                    otherwise your browser will generate one for you on the fly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your browser uses your target data and the private key to
                    compute a digital signature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We upload that signature to our servers, so that when you
                    share your data, others can use certish to verify that it
                    came from you and hasn&apos;t been tampered with. If
                    you&apos;re signing a file, we&apos;ll also upload the
                    filename and MIME type to our servers, so that you and the
                    file&apos;s recipients can more easily identify it. The
                    contents of your data are never transmitted to certish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We&apos;ll generate a pseydonym and public profile profile
                    for you, so that when others verify your data, they&apos;ll
                    be able to see where it came from. A cookie will be stored
                    in your browser, so that if you choose to sign in or claim a
                    persistent profile, your keys and signatures will stay with
                    you.

            <WideParagraph>When you verify data with certish:</WideParagraph>
            <ol>
                <li>Your browser computes a crypographic hash of the data.</li>
                <li>
                    We upload that hash to our servers. If we haven&apos;t seen
                    the hash before, that means that the data hasn&apos;t been
                    signed by certish, and we&apos;ll let you know that we
                    couldn&apos;t verify it. Otherwise, we&apos;ll proceed...
                </li>
                <li>
                    We send your browser the digital signature, public key, and
                    public user profile we have on file for your target data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your browser uses the target data and the public key to
                    verify the signature.
