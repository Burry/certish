                We believe that your data is your business. When you use certish
                to sign or verify data, the contents of that data never leave
                your browser. Also, not a single lawyer has looked at this
                Privacy Policy, and it&apos;s evolving as we develop our
                product, so don&apos;t @ us.

            <TightHeading level={3}>Signing</TightHeading>
            <WideParagraph>
                When you sign data with certish, this is what happens:
            </WideParagraph>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If you&apos;re signed in to your certish account and have an
                    associated private key, we&apos;ll securely send your
                    private key to your browser (encrypted with your password),
                    otherwise your browser will generate one for you on the fly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your browser uses your target data and private key to
                    compute a digital signature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We upload a hash of your data, your public key, and the
                    signature to our servers and attach these to a new signature
                    URL. When you share your data, others can use your signature
                    URL to verify that it came from you and hasn&apos;t been
                    tampered with. If you&apos;re signing a file, we&apos;ll
                    also upload the filename and MIME type to our servers, so
                    that you and the file&apos;s recipients can more easily
                    identify it. The contents of your data are never transmitted
                    to certish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you&apos;re not using an account, we&apos;ll generate a
                    pseydonym and public profile for you, so that when others
                    verify your data, they&apos;ll be able to see where it came
                    from. A cookie will be stored in your browser, so that if
                    you choose to sign in or create an account, your keys and
                    signatures will stay with you by transferring the cookie to
                    our servers.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <TightHeading level={4}>Creating an Account</TightHeading>
            <WideParagraph>
                You can use certish without an account, using a
                randomly-generated pseudonym to identify your signatures. If you
                would prefer to sign data using a custom identity and/or with
                the same identity across multiple devices, you will need to
                create an account with us. When you sign up for an account after
                creating a signature, your private key will be encrypted with
                your account password and uploaded to our servers so that you
                can sign your data from any device. That&apos;s one reason why
                you should use a strong password! When you create an account, we
                may collect identifying information such as your email address,
                phone number, and/or connection to a third-party identity
                provider such as Apple, Google, or Facebook.
            </WideParagraph>
            <TightHeading level={3}>Verification</TightHeading>
            <WideParagraph>When you verify data with certish:</WideParagraph>
            <ol>
                <li>Your browser computes a crypographic hash of the data.</li>
                <li>
                    We upload that hash to our servers. If we haven&apos;t seen
                    the hash before, that means that the data hasn&apos;t been
                    signed by certish, and we&apos;ll let you know that we
                    couldn&apos;t verify it. Otherwise, we&apos;ll proceed...
                </li>
                <li>
                    We send your browser the digital signature, public key, and
                    public user profile we have on file for your target data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your browser uses the target data and the public key to
                    verify the signature.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <TightHeading level={2}>Compliance</TightHeading>
            <WideParagraph>
                It may be required by law, litigation, and/or bullying by lawful
                authorities with jurisdiction over certish to disclose your
                personal information and/or information related to your use of
                certish. We may also disclose information about you to these
                lawful entities if we determine that it is necessary for law
                enforcement purposes.
